    //create a local variable that when empty, does nothing on button press
    //but once the user has tapped one of the operators it sets the variable to that operator
    //start button then uses this to determine the type of game that is displayed on the game screen

    //name: startButtonPressed variables: operatorIdentifier, Difficulty

//TODO: buttons need to showTouchWhenHighlighted and be formatted
